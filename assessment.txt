Take-Home Assessment: Software Engineer, Automation
You are tasked to design and implement a Playwright + TypeScript test suite for
Automation Exercise. Target site: https://automationexercise.com/
Business Scenario
Pre-test: Navigate to https://automationexercise.com/ and register a new account.
1. Login with the created account. *Manage your credentials properly.
2. Go to the product page and filter products by a category.
3. Verify that the filtered results are displayed correctly. *Verify at least the first
item displayed.
4. Add an item to the cart. Go to the Cart and verify the product is present and
the price is correct.
5. Go back to the previous page and verify the filtered results still valid.
6. View another item’s detail page and verify attributes (name, price). Add the
item to the Cart.
7. Open the Cart, remove the first added item, and verify it has been removed.
8. Proceed to Checkout. Fill in the required forms with mock data.
9. Complete the payment process successfully.
Technical Requirements
• This is ONE continuous test flow, covering end-to-end user interactions.
• Use Playwright Test with TypeScript (strict mode).
• Implement Page Object Model (POM).
• Maintain selectors in dedicated files (not inside Page Objects).
• Define models/interfaces where appropriate (e.g., Product, CartItem).
• Use fixtures for authenticated sessions where relevant.
• Ensure robust waits (avoid hard sleeps).
• Use Prettier for formatting.
• A readable HTML report is required: clear test names, meaningful assertions,
traces on retry, screenshots on failure.
• You may edit the provided playwright.config.ts to meet the requirements.
• Provide a README.md following the template provided.
• For any steps that need you to do verification, you may either
o Extract product details at runtime, or
o Use test data files to store and retrieve inputs (e.g., product names).
